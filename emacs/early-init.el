;; Emacs Lisp is a garbage collected language.  This is great, but
;; Emacs initialization creates a large amount of garbage, and garbage
;; collection runs frequently during startup.  We can increase the
;; amount of memory allowed for allocation before the garbage
;; collector is invoked to speed up initialization.  We want to
;; restore it for normal operation, however.

;; Emacs 28.1 introduced native code compilation of Emacs lisp, which

;; or want cluttering up our Emacs config directory.
